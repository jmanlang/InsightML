# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Analysis-Project
My final project for my Machine Learning Basics class. I was given a large, messy dataset
full of flaws, such as inconsistent data types, missing values, unnamed categories, and
missing units of measurement (View data.txt). From this, I was tasked with cleaning the dataset, finding
potential correlations between data categories, and deducing the overall purpose of the 
dataset
